## Lessons Learnt From the Git Crash Program

We learnt how to
- Rebase
- Solve/ prevent a merge conflict

## Operation 2 : Mark's Trial
Purpose of a rebase is to remove the need for a merge request.

## Operation 3: Undoing Git commit
One can do a git commit in several ways for example through a git reset or git revert depending on whether it has been pushed online.
